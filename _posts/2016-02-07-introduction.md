**Introduction**
Hi guys, it's a long time, I have started writing my blogs again for Mobile Enterprise development and Swift programming.

**About Me**
I am having 8+ in software development (iOS). I also prefer to write backend apis in NodeJS. I basically like to write small apps on *DB optimization, utilities and migration process*, *Network API utilities for supporting multiple type of format and multiple network calls consecutively*.
